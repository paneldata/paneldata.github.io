The SOEP started in 1984 as a longitudinal survey of private households
in the Federal Republic of Germany. The central aim then and now is to
collect representative micro-data to measure stability and change in
living conditions by following a micro-economic approach enriched with
variables from sociology and political science (influenced by the
"Social Indicator" movement). Therefore the central survey
instruments are a houeshold questionnaire, which is responded by the
head of a household and an individual questionnaire, which each
household member is intended to answer. Furthermore beginning with 1997,
there are wave-specific $LELA files (Lebenslauf - engl. life
course) containing the biography information as collected in the
respective year.

A rather stable set of core questions is asked every year covering the
most essential areas of interest of the SOEP:

* population and demography
* education, training, and qualification
* labor market and occupational dynamics
* earnings, income and social security
* housing
* health
* household production
* preferences and values
* satisfaction with life in general and certain aspects of life.

Additionally, yearly topical modules enhance the basic information in
(at least) one of these areas by asking detailed questions as documented
in Table 1 and Figure 1. These modules for the main part
appear in the personal questionnaires; only some of them are additions
to the household questionnaire. Starting in the year 2001, the data have
become even richer by including several different health measures and
well-known psychological concepts as well as age specific
questionnaires.

Since the year 2000, youths (turning 17 during the survey year) form a
new group of respondents with a specific questionnaire suited to their
situation. The questions cover their situation at home, including the
relationship to their parents and friends. School and job aspirations
are a major part, while some of the psychological measures available for
the adults (e.g. Big Five, risk aversion) are also taken. Overall, the
youth questionnaire provides a broad overview of the individual’s
situation at a very interesting and potentially influencial point in
their life.

Since 2003 SOEP also asks parents about their young children, by
implementing age specific questionnaires. In 2003, a first questionnaire
was added for infants and very young children born during the current or
previous survey year. Since then, four additional questionnaires have
been added for children in different age groups. In 2012, parents were
asked about their children turning 10 during the current survey year for
the first time. The topics in these questionnaires vary with the age of
the child - for an overview, see Table 2.

Table 2: Overview of Proxy Questionnaires for Young Children

| Questionnaire | Age Group (years) | First used in | Respondent | Topics |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Mother-Child A | 0-1 | 2003 | Mother | Child Health; Circumstances of Pregnancy; Child Care |
| Mother-Child B | 2-3 | 2005 | Mother (Father) | Child Health; Child Care; Compentecies |
| Mother-Child C | 5-6 | 2008 | Mother (Father) | Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ); Child Health; Child Care; Activities |
| Parent-Child D | 7-8 | 2010 | Mother and Father | Educational Goals; Upbringing Styles and Goals; Child Care |
| Mother-Child E | 9-10 | 2012 | Mother (Father) | Educational Goals and School Performance; Activities; Child Health; Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ); Child Care |

(Note that for all questionnaires except the Parent-Child D the mother
is the first choice to fill out the questionnaire, whereas the father is
meant to answer only if the mother is not available.)

Especially Table 1 shows that the SOEP evolved
in various directions over the course of its existence. New topics will
continue to be introduced in future waves of data collection, depending
on what is important for the scientific community.
