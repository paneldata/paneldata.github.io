title: "Target Population and Samples"

The target population covered in the SOEP is defined as the
residential population living in private households within the current
boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Because of
changes in these boundaries (in 1990) and changes in the residential
population due to migration, various adaptations have been applied to
the initial sampling structure to keep the sample's
representativity. In addition, certain groups have been oversampled to
increase the statistical power.

In 1984, the survey started with a sample covering the entire
population in then West Germany (FRG), where the five biggest groups
of foreigners (the so-called "guestworkers") were oversampled.

> The institutionalized population, in the true sense of the word
(hospitals, nursing homes, military installations) is generally not
representatively included in new samples. E.g. in 1984 only 57
institutionalized households are included. Later, however, persons
from the initial households who have taken up residence temporarily or
permanently in institutions of this kind are followed. For a detailed
description of the problems in covering this population in the SOEP,
see Hanefeld (1987).

The SOEP was expanded to the territory of the German Democratic
Republic in June 1990, only six months after the fall of the Berlin
Wall. A further addition in 1994/95 was a sample of migrants who came
to Germany after 1984, to take the influx of ethnic Germans from
former Soviet countries into account. Two samples respresentative of
the entire population in Germany were added in 1998 and 2000, to
counter effects of panel attrition and to increase the overall sample
size. In 2002, a high income sample was added, while in 2006 and 2009,
additional refreshment samples were drawn.

To increase the overall sample size SOEP has started adding
refreshment samples in 2011. While the first (in 2011) and second
(2012) extensions are representative of the whole population, the
third (2013) is supposed to explicitly cover migrants. For the fourth
extension in 2014, the related study "Families in Germany", covering
mainly families, will be integrated into the SOEP.

The different samples in the SOEP are identified by letters: sample
"A" refers to the German sample drawn in 1984, "C" to the East Germans
from 1990, and so on. Even though these samples are kept separate, the
respondents recieved identical questionnaires for the most part and
distinctions by sample are usually not be necessary in an analysis.

> However, one of the ideas of SOEP is, that the users have full
information available about survey methodological issues and survey
design. Which means in this case that you can of course identify the
corresponding sample for each observation. In the following section,
we present details on each of the samples, which - unless stated
otherwise - are multi-stage random samples with regional clusters. The
respondent's households are selected by random-walk routines. For an
extensive discussion on sampling (and weighting) see @Kroh2012.

### i. The SOEP Samples in Detail

**Sample A "Residents in the FRG"** covers persons in private
households with a household head, who does not belong to one of the
main foreigner groups of "guestworkers" (i.e. Turkish, Greek,
Yugoslavian, Spanish or Italian households). Because only a few
foreigners are in Sample A it is often called the "West German Sample"
of the SOEP. In 1984 it covered 4,528 households with a sampling
probability of about 0.0002.

**Sample B "Foreigners in the FRG"** adds persons in private
households with a Turkish, Greek, Yugoslavian, Spanish or Italian
household head, which in 1984 constituted the main groups of
foreigners in the FRG. Compared to Sample A the population of Sample B
is oversampled with a sampling probability of about 0.002. The first
wave included 1,393 households in Sample B.

**Sample C "German Residents in the GDR"** consists of persons in
private households where the household head was a citizen of the
German Democratic Republic (GDR). This meant that approximately 1.7%
of the residential population in the GDR in June 1990 was excluded
from the sample as foreigners (who were mostly institutionalized). All
in all, 2,179 households represent the starting size of this sample
with a sampling probability of about 0.0005.

**Sample D "Immigrants"** started in 1994/95 with two different
samples. In 1994, the first sample D1 had 236 households and in 1995,
the second sample D2 had 295 households, leading to a total of 531
households (D1 and D2) in 1995.  This sample consisted of households
in which at least one household member had moved from abroad to West
Germany after 1984. The sampling probability is about 0.0002.

**Sample E "Refreshment"** was added in 1998, selected from the entire
population of private households in Germany. The households were
chosen independently from the ongoing panel and its subsamples A
through D, with the targets of increasing the number of observations
of the general population and preserving its representativity. The
selection scheme used for sample E essentially resembles the one used
in subsample A. The number of households in the first wave of
subsample E was $1,060$, with a sampling probability of about
0.00005. With the data distribution of 2012, parts of subsample E have
been extracted into the SOEP Innovation Sample.

**Sample F "Refreshment"** was selected independently from all other
subsamples from the population of private households in 2000. The
selection scheme was slightly altered compared to the previous
addition in Sample E: while the ’German’ households (all adults
greater or equal 16 in the household have German nationality) were
selected with a sampling probability of $0.00028$, the ’non-German’
households (at least one adult does not have German nationality) where
oversampled with a probability of 0.0005.  Overall, the number of
added households in subsample F’s first wave amounts to 6,043.

**Sample G "High Income"** entered the SOEP in 2002 independently from
all other subsamples. The original selection scheme required that the
responding households had a monthly income of at least DM 7,500 (EUR
3,835), which - due to the lack of an adequate sampling frame - were
identified using a screening procedure. This sample of overall 1,224
households increased the potential for analyses in the high income
areas, which previously were difficult to conduct because of low case
numbers. The derived sampling probability is about 0.0014. Starting
with Wave 2 in 2003, the selection scheme for this subsample was
changed such that only households with a net monthly income of at
least EUR 4,500 were followed.

**Sample H "Refreshment"** started in 2006 as a random sample, again
independently of all previous subsamples, covering all residential
households in Germany. The addition of 1,506 households was drawn with
a sampling probability of 0.0001.

**Sample I "Incentive sample"** started in 2009, where in the first
wave, a new incentive scheme was tested to increase participation
rates (see also [sec:PanelCare]. The sampling was independent of all
other SOEP-samples, adding a total number of 1,531 households to the
SOEP. Their sampling probability was 0.00013. This sample remained in
the main data distribution for its first two waves (i.e. 2010 and
2011, or waves Z and BA). With the data distribution of 2012,
subsample I has been extracted into the SOEP Innovation Sample.

**Sample J "Refreshment sample"** started in 2011 as a random sample
that was drawn independently of all previous subsamples, covering the
residential households in Germany. The addition of 3,136 households
was drawn with a sampling probability of 0.0002.

**Sample K "Refreshment sample"** started in 2012 as a random sample,
drawn independently of all previous subsamples, covering the
residential households in Germany. The addition of 1,526 households
was drawn with a sampling probability of 0.0001.

In 2013 a new **migration sample** was added with around 2,700
households drawn by using register information of the German Federal
Employment Agency.

### ii. Eligibility and Follow-up

As mentioned, the SOEP’s goal is to be representative of the
residential population of Germany. All household members 16 and older
are eligible for a personal interview, starting with the youth
questionnaire at that age, followed by "regular" person questionnaires
thereafter. As years go by, the children of the first wave reach
age-eligibility and become panel members. If they move out and form
their own families, they and their new families are still part of the
survey. "New" persons become part of the SOEP population due to birth
or residential mobility. In case a person enters a SOEP household
after the initial wave, this person is asked to fill out the regular
person questionnaire if age-eligible, or will be asked to participate
once old enough. Thus in the absence of panel attrition the SOEP would
be a self-sustaining survey.

The concept of how to follow the respondents and sample members over
time is important for the representativeness of the study. The basic
principle for follow-up in the SOEP is that all persons participating
in a wave of any subsample are to be surveyed in the following years
as long as they stay within the boundaries of Germany. This rule also
extends to respondents who entered a SOEP-household after the first
wave due to residential mobility or birth. If there is a "split-off",
i.e. people move out of the household they were last interviewed in,
the members of the new household receive a new household identifier.
Table 3 conceptualizes how new sample members and households are
realized in the SOEP. Figure 2 shows that as a result of the follow-up
concept, up to , several thousand "new" households became part of the
SOEP population. The weighting scheme takes into account this complete
"follow-up" (see @Kroh2012).

Persons or households who could not be interviewed in a given year are
termed “temporary drop-outs”. These are followed until there are two
consecutive waves of missing interviews for all household members or a
final refusal of the complete household. In the case of a cooperation
after a temporary drop-out, the respondent is asked to fill out an
additional short questionnaire on central information on employment
and demographics during the year of absence.

|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|

| New Persons        | Birth <br>Move-in   | Move-in or birth into move-out household |

### Development of Sample Sizes

Individuals who refuse participation or are not available for an
interview are kept in the so-called "gross" sample of the study as
long as they continue to live in households with at least one
participating person. Once the entire household declines to respond in
two consecutive waves of data collection, all individuals from the
household are removed from the SOEP. Table 4 shows the starting sample
sizes of samples A through J, the years when the samples were first
collected, as well as the percentage of those persons who were
eligible for an interview but declined participation ("partial unit
non-response", PUNR) in the first wave. Figure 3 illustrates the
development of the number of successful person interviews
since 1984. The reduction in the population size for all individual
samples is mainly the result of person-level drop-outs, refusals,
moving abroad, etc. However, due to new persons moving into already
existing households, and children reaching the minimum respondent’s
age of 16, and thereby increasing the sample size, this negative
development is offset somewhat.

This cross-sectional view is insufficient when examining the
longitudinal development of the sample, which is influenced by
different demographic and field-work related factors. As already shown
in Table 3, demographic reasons for entering the panel are birth and
residential mobility. Analogously, the demographic reasons for a panel
exit are death and moving abroad. Fieldwork related reasons are
different, in that they relate to the interaction between the
interviewer and the responding household. Respondents are either not
reached for an interview (non-contact) or they decline to participate
for the current year. Figure 4 illustrates the longitudinal
development of first-wave respondents in 1984, as well as their
children, of samples A and B.
