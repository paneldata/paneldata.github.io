## Introduction

Each year from 2001 to 2011, the SOEP questionnaire for the following wave was pretested in the summer of the preceding year. The objective of these pretests was to test new modules and modifications of questions.
The SOEP-Pretest went far beyond the standard format of a pretest: the sample size was around 1,000 respondents per year and can be considered representative for the German resident population of 16 years and older (Siegel et al. 2009).
Within the SOEP there are two main differences between the pretests and the main survey.
First, all interviews in the SOEP-Pretests are programmed as CAPI versions (in contrast, in the main survey some of the interviews are based on paper-and-pencil questionnaires). Consequently, the SOEP-Pretests were particularly useful to test experimental designs.
Second, whereas in the main survey all members of a household from the age 16 on are interviewed, the SOEP-Pretests were arranged in a much simpler fashion: there was one questionnaire to be filled out by one member of a household.
The pretest sample is not related to the main survey, meaning that these respondents are not part of the panel study. The interviews of the SOEP-Pretests were usually conducted in the period from August 1st to 31st. Normally, the duration of a single interview was about 45 minutes.

Information about the thematic priority of each pretest will follow.
